<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> The name Nipson carries a sense of uniqueness, depth, and heritage. Rooted in ancient Greek, it is most famously associated with the palindrome phrase:

"Νίψον ἀνομήματα μὴ μόναν ὄψιν"
"Wash the sins, not only the face."

This timeless expression—found inscribed on fountains and baptismal fonts in Orthodox Christian traditions—emphasizes the importance of inner integrity, self-awareness, and genuine growth. As a name, Nipson reflects values of reflection, authenticity, and continuous self-improvement.

Having a name with such a rich cultural and philosophical background is more than just a personal identifier—it is a reminder to lead with purpose, strive for excellence, and maintain depth in both thought and action.
